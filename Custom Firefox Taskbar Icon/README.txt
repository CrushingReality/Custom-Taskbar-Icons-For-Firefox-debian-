This is the command I came up with to change the taskbar icon for firefox to whatever you want.




You will need to make a folder called "default" and place it in the Documents folder (you can put it wherever you want though).


Then you will need to make 5 versions of the image you want to use. These will need to be called "default16" "default32" "default48" "default64" and "default128". Each image’s resolution corresponds to its name. And they will need to be .png files. I'm not sure you actually need to make them different resolutions but I would just to be on the safe side.


Unfortunately the custom icons are temporary and will return to the default one whenever firefox updates. I just run the command any time I see something firefox related during an update.




Apologies if I have done anything wrong this is the first time I am posting to github. If you need to contact me you can do so via my discord "crushingreality"
